Clyde - Father Marcus

Father - *praying...*
Father - How can I help you son?
Clyde - Father, the World is in DANGER!!
Father - In Danger? Why?

(mediante a decis√£o inicial)
1)Clyde - Abaddon is coming and we need to STOP HIM.
2)Clyde - Abaddon will save us all, he's our savior, JOIN US and your lives will be spared.
3)Clyde - Abaddon is arriving, the scariest beast the World has ever seen, we need to RUN AWAY FROM HERE!

Father - I hope this isn't another bad joke!
Clyde - It's not! I wouldn't come here and interrupt your prayers in vain...
Father - Why do you think I can believe you?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<DECISION>
1)We need to be alive to keep loving Him. the only way is to ESCAPE from this World!
2)You represent God's strenght, the one capable to help us from the end of the World.
3)We are not praying for the right God! Believe it or not, Pogbeast is the only God you will ever see for yourself

R1)Priest - You may be right, we need to save ourselves in order to continue His existence, if this is true... 
R2) Of course, He can guide us indeed
R3) Dont' you ever say that again!!! There's only one God to guide us.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Father - Well, with just that, I'm still not very convinced...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<DECISION>
1)Your followers just follow you because of your God, when they're facing Abaddon, they will bow down to him. This is your oportunity to keep them on your side.
2)You have the most followers behind you, your help is crucial. More people means greater chances of BEATING him!
3)Many people follows you. You can SAVE them!! We need to bring as many as possible with us...

R1) *thinking* ("Is this God so powerful?? This kid might not be joking")
R2) Well, you may have a point, nothing is more powerful than fighting for God...
R3) Indeed, if this is a real problem, you're quite right.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Father - I can see that this isn't a joke son...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<DECISION>
1)Father, you know, deep in you, that FIGHTING Abaddon is the best way to really show the God's power! 
2)Now it's up to you, either you're with us, or you're against us! With or without you, Abaddon will turn this World apart. 
3)Please Father, Abaddon is bringing the END. We really need to find a way to get out of here.

R1) I really have that power in my hands, right now...
R2) Uhm... Uhm... He seems really powerful, according to you...
R3) This seems really serious. Maybe it's best to save ourselves...

Clyde - Alright, I guess I have nothing more to say. Your call!
Father - Alright, alright son. May God be with you!
