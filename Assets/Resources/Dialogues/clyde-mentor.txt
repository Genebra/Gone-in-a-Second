Clyde - Mentor

Mentor - Hey, hey, calm down. Finally, you're awake now!
Clyde - Uhm... uhm...
Mentor - So you're Clyde?
Clyde - Yes... How do you know me? 
Mentor- Hi! I'm Jack James, but you can call me J.J. I'm a journalist from the Dabot County Post 
and I represent the MCSO, Myhstical Creatures Secret Organization. We've been doing some researches and 
thse researches told us the one thing we feared: ABADDON IS COMING!
Clyde -  I' aware of that. It may sound ridiculous but I saw him... In the future! The moment he arrived!
Mentor - OH MY GOD! THAT'S IT!
Clyde - ...What? I don't understand...
Mentor - Our research also told us that someone is destined to help us somehow, someone who knows the beast,
who knows what to do... IT'S YOU!
Clyde - You think so?
Mentor - For sure! You''re the only one who has seen him. You have the answers.
Please, tell me what should we do? I can help you!

<<BIG DECISION>>
1) We need to gather everyone to fight together. As a unit, we have the power to KILL HIM!
2) He is completely invencible, the best we can do is gather every people we can and RUN AWAY FROM HERE!
3) This isn't bad at all. His arriving is the best that happened to Dabot County. ABADDON is our
savior, we need to JOIN HIM to rule the World!

Mentor - Wow... That's... PERFECT! And I think I can help you...
