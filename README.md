In Gone in a Second you race against time to raise awareness towards the forthcoming of Abaddon, he who brings the end of the World.

Playing in a 2D pixelated visual style, you must control Clyde through fast paced decisions to convince the most influential people you can find to help you spread the word about the impending battle to come.

Your speaking skills will help you recruit people for you cause. Each decision must be made in less than ten seconds.

The world and story will evolve with your decisions as you get closer to coming of Abaddon.

This project was done with Unity by a 4 person team with my role being to draw all the art for the game.
